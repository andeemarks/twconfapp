				<p>A March 2009 Business Week article proclaims, "There is no more Normal." In the throws of such pervasive change the traditional emphasis on "following the plan with minimal changes," needs to be supplanted by an agile stress on "adapting successfully to inevitable changes." Furthermore, if agility is about delivering customer value by being flexible, then how can adherence to a traditional scope, schedule, and cost plan be the best way to measure performance? It can't. We need to move beyond the classic Iron Triangle measures to an Agile Triangle that focuses on Value, Quality, and Constraints.</p>
				<p>Agile teams are asked to be agile, flexible, and adaptive, but then are told to conform to planned scope, schedule, and cost goals. They are asked to adapt, but inside a very small box. If we are to scale agility to large projects and bring agile values to organizations, then we must change performance measures. To mirror the Agile Manifesto, it's not that scope, schedule, and cost are unimportant, but that value and quality are more important. This keynote explores the necessity for and the rationale behind moving to this new set of agile performance measures.</p>

				<p>Almost ten years ago I had the good fortune to be at a workshop that led to the coining of the term "Agile" and the writing of the "Manifesto for Agile Software Development". Since then I've watched as ThoughtWorks, my employer, has embraced software agility and applied it on projects all over the world. During these years the concept of Agile has become more and more mainstream, but as with any radical idea, popularity tends to introduce diffusion. So I find it's important to revisit the core essence of these ideas, so they don't get lost in the noise of widespread adoption.</p>

				<p>Agile Organisation, Process and Practice brolly Context is everything - there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach to project delivery. The Agile umbrella encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches. This talk briefly examines a variety of the techniques and identifies the "project ecosystem" elements that will enable them to be effective, where they work best, where they are to be avoided and practical advice on how to get the maximum benefit from each of the practices.</p>
				<p>Shane presents a framework for selecting from a variety of techniques to identify the combination that will work most effectively in a specific project environment. This talk doesn't attempt to teach the techniques; rather Shane provides some concrete advice for selecting from techniques such as: brainstorming, mind maps, DeBono's thinking hats, vision box, structured interviews, questionnaires, scriptwriting, snowcards, use cases, user stories, process models, decision tables, data models, planning poker, behaviour driven development, low-fi prototypes, and CRC cards.</p>

				<p>Culture, Leadership, People brolly If you need to push through a substantial technology transformation - and are wondering whether a simultaneous transition to Agile will help or hinder your organisation to digest a major technology change - then this talk is for you.</p>
				<p>In this talk, Daniel Oertli reflects on the experience of rebuilding a major website - realestate.com.au - in under a year on a new platform, running on new infrastructure, delivered with newly-introduced Agile practices. Daniel will answer questions such as: "How do you quickly raise a team's overall tempo?" and "How can a change to Agile reduce change?". The talk includes recommendations for making 'all-in' people, process and technology transformations 'stick' and deliver, and a candid view of the pitfalls and learnings during REA's journey.</p>

In this talk, Ben Hogan looks at the idea of using an Agile approach to introducing Agile into an organisation in a congruent and incremental way and with the benefits of using an Agile method: early delivery of business value, the flexibility to adapt to organisational constraints. Drawing on Ben's eight years of Agile experience and a number of recent publications this talk gives attendees a practical approach to introducing Agile into their organisation. Ben will answer questions such as: "Where do I start?" and "How do I introduce Agile into a large traditional organisation?" The talk includes an introduction to the most important organisational change models and provides attendees a number of recommendations and tips on what to avoid in their Agile journey.</p>

In searching for a "silver bullet" as Fred Brooks stated so many years ago, the disruptive nature of Agile to an organisation's processes, management models and culture is too often ignored until too late.</p>
				<p>Agile is not a new method for project development, it is a total re-definition of how an organisation delivers change. In this session, Rob will present a systemic view of Agile and how two leading organisations have used Agile sponsorship, Agile project management, and Agile development as a critical part of building a new organisational paradigm.</p>

				<p>Agile Organisation, Process and Practice brolly It's a common and understandable request to want to know how "Agile" you are but there is a great risk of being distracted by process compliance rather than staying focused on improvement and delivering business value. Agile Maturity Assessments typically take a few people's opinions of where the team is at, then dictates how to change - but that rarely 'sticks.' The problem still exists that we need to know how well we are doing and what to do next, and teams will buy in and drive this change if they assess the situation themselves. This presentation will discuss how to do this in a way that stays focused on our goals and not on our Agile score.</p>

				<p>Business Value brolly Allianz began to adopt elements of Agile delivery practices a few years ago, and learnt some unique lessons that led to two full blown Agile pilot projects to be established in 2009. The aim was to assess Agile and promote the practice as an acceptable alternate form of software delivery where appropriate. Also embodied in the aim was the establishment of agreed SDLC deliverables and activities to ensure relevant governance and reduce confusion. Consideration was also given to the key behaviours required in the team and how to build broader corporate adoption.</p>
				<p>This talk will provide insight into Enterprise Agile Adoption from an experience view, sharing how Agile was adopted at Allianz Australia Insurance. We will discuss lessons learnt and tips on how to overcome inertia, what would be done differently with hindsight and how you can go about getting Agile accepted as a way of meeting ever expanding expectations.</p>

				<p>Culture, Leadership, People brolly High performing teams are something that all organisations aspire to, but how exactly do you turn a team from good to great? There is much discussion in the community about management versus leadership, working in a factory versus embracing a tribe and how to motivate a new generation of employees. In this presentation we will look at these topics and determine what makes a high performing team, how Agile techniques can help, what tools and techniques you can use to create this environment and how you can measure performance.</p>

				<p>Business Value brolly The story of information management at NOPSA begins in the distant past, at a time when the most advanced form of information is a spreadsheet, and most business activities are completely dependent on the movement of pieces of paper. The inhabitants of this primeval world resolve to create an application that assists their core business processes, reduces their compliance burden and prevents data rot.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the project faces some challenges.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>The defining legislation is being added to and amended at unpredictable intervals - by three or four governments.</li>
				<li>Some of the business processes have never been agreed on.</li>
				<li>Senior management believe that 80% of software development projects end in catastrophic failure and financial waste.</li>
				<li>â€¦ and a minor cargo cult has developed around the project, with each stakeholder believing that their specialised requirements will be delivered.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Recognising that a classic sequential project would waste resources from day one, NOPSA began a search for a development capability that would be flexible, achieve results quickly and focus relentlessly on user needs.</p>
				<p>This is the story of how we delivered less software, but more business value than we expected. It is also a story of how management skepticism evolved into commitment, and how our inspectors' anxiety gave way to ownership.</p>
				<p>There is a brief discussion of what worked well, particularly those characteristics of NOPSA that were useful to the process (yes, they can exist in a government agency !).</p>
				<p>This session finishes with a summary of the factors that have made Agile 'the way we do things' at NOPSA.</p>

				<p>Agile Organisation, Process and Practice brolly Successful businesses have large application and product legacies which require care and feeding over their useful lifetime. In major product companies significant revenue comes from customers of existing legacy products and their support revenues. Hence it isn't surprising that 70-85% of the software development budget is allocated to the operation and enhancement Legacy Code. For many companies their most successful product/application has become their worst enemy. Painfully we have learned that languages, tools, methods and practices we have often been unable to replace or even substantially reduce the entropy of our legacy code. Indeed it is generally accepted today that a major rewrite of any large legacy application has way too much risk and way too little business value to be given serious consideration. We have no choice but to live with and improve our Legacy!</p>
				<p>Unfortunately major Legacy Systems is an area where most in Agile community fear to tread. This is due in part to their lack of experience in these environments. It is also due to their expectations for tool chains and deployment models which are matched to the Agile expectations of incremental OO development and associated tool chains.</p>
				<p>In this talk we discuss how Lean thinking and Agile have been applied to real legacy systems spanning mainframe, military, embedded and multi-vendor integration of legacy and EAP applications. We illustrate by example how organisations can benefit by using Lean and Agile to reduce the entropy (improve Agility) of their legacy systems and hence maximize the value they can get from them. We discuss appropriate investments in training, tooling and practices for different legacy environments.</p>

				<p>Culture, Leadership, People brolly Agile requires a fundamental change in how we manage projects and lead people. How we motivate and provide structure for project teams requires equal emphasis with what we are delivering.</p>
				<p>Accordingly, our view of project managers is changing. In contrast to more traditional approaches, Agile promotes project management into the realms of business management as a truly valued capability in its own right. Underscoring this increased profile is a need to quickly establish credibility and trust - in that context, an Agile approach is particularly effective.</p>
				<p>I will be elaborating on the changing role of project managers within organisations and the application of Agile practices with business teams. Specifically, the new skills required by project managers to become more effective facilitators of change and delivery along with some of the challenges of adopting Agile with business teams.</p>

				<p>Innovation and Emerging Ideas brolly This session describes the current thinking about emergent design, discovering design in code. The hazard of Big Design Up Front in software is that you don't yet know what you don't know, and design decisions made too early are just speculations without facts. Emergent design techniques allow you to wait until the last responsible moment to make design decisions. This talk covers three areas: emergent design enablers, battling things that make emergent design hard, finding idiomatic patterns, and how to leverage the patterns you find. It includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualisations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilising them. The goal of this talk is to provide nomenclature, strategies, and techniques for allowing design to emerge from projects as they proceed, keeping you code in sync with the problem domain. This talk shows lots of examples of how to make this concept work in your environment.</p>

				<p>Culture, Leadership, People brolly Who has ever thought about why Agile is such a simple concept that is so difficult to implement? Fact is, it is not simple at all - the problem of creating innovative solutions through the collective effort of a group of individuals is extremely difficult and one that needs significant effort. But the harder question is the one to ask that guy looking at you in the mirror. The hardest and most difficult problem we have is to introspect and understand what I must do. My presentation will consider: what is leadership for an Agile project and how/what are the tools we need to ask ourselves regularly. Introspection is the best tool I have learnt as a coach and my goal is to encourage you to the same.</p>

				<p>Culture, Leadership, People brolly When a business adopts Agile it must quickly learn to get the most from its development teams. High performing teams are highly aligned, aligned from the business right the way through to developers and testers. Achieving such an alignment needs understanding, a clear plan, and skilful execution. Product owners and developers think differently, are motivated by different goals and can often talk at cross-purposes. Each side has its own success and failure stereotypes. Often these are from polar opposites and can have immense difficulty communicating effectively with each other.</p>
				<p>Resolving this dichotomy requires teams to speak the same language and to speak it fluently. That language is expressed in User Stories. They must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Articulate the business need in a language everyone appreciates</li>
					<li>Incorporate technical value in business speak</li>
					<li>Require consistent dialogue leading to less assumptions and errors</li>
					<li>Be prioritized to allow a trade off between scope and time while maintaining value</li>

				<p>Innovation and Emerging Ideas brolly Many Australian organisations are being driven to find a better way to deliver projects at the pace that competition demands in 2010. Lonely Planet started on that journey in their IT group in late 2007, and three years later the petrie dish that was the initial Agile implementation has overflowed with interesting organisms. Agile principles are now evident in teams as variable as legal, HR, guidebook publishing, product development, and IT operations.</p>
				<p>A field trip to Lonely Planet starts to answer the question "what happens when a whole company starts adopting Agile methods?" Since not everyone can come to Footscray however, in this presentation you will see which Agile principles work for each team, how groups work together, whether 'competitive Agile' can work, and the flywheel effect on the productivity of core IT teams from widespread understanding of Agile principles - now that their colleagues across the business use card walls, talk about stories and conduct daily stand-ups.</p>
				<p>You will also hear how key steps in the broader adoption of Agile, how the insistence of uniformity of Agile process can be a killer of innovation, and how Agile underpinned the delivery of a new iPad digital product from the day Apple called to say "we've announced the iPad, we've emailed your SDK - we expect a product in iTunes when we hit the market in a month".</p>

				<p>Culture, Leadership, People brolly Come along and participate in Dr W. Edwards Deming's famous Red Bead Experiment. This classic learning tool helps illustrate the impact that a system, and traditional management approaches, can have on individuals who work within an organisation.</p>
				<p>The experiment introduces many of Deming's ideas about management, including his 14 Points for Management. It also introduces the Statistical Process Control Chart.</p>
				<p>Originally used by Dr Deming as part of his four-day seminar, the experiment represents a corporation formed of "willing workers", quality control personnel, a data recorder, a Project Manager and a Product Owner, each of which is staffed by volunteers from the audience.</p>
				<p>The corporation's aim is to produce white beads. The production of beads is controlled by an approved procedure to ensure the removal of defective red beads.</p>
				<p>After the experiment there will be a discussion of the issues addressed by the experiment, including: understanding variation in work, the role of the system on the performance of the workers, the effectiveness of managing with slogans, the usefulness of targets, annual appraisals and financial rewards, and how to improve quality.</p>
				<p>We will also relate this experiment to approaches to Software Development and the management of software development teams.</p>
