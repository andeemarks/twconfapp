Hi. You're the new star!

The Agile 2010 app, courtesy of... **you**!

Building
--------

**TODO**

Deployment
----------

It seems like you might want to know a few things. First:

> http://rufiao.github.com/agile2010/

That loads the gh-pages branch of this repository, all rendered and beautiful.
You could host locally. Or on a web server.

But, this entire project is a static set of HTML, JS, CSS and friends.

You know how to deploy that, right?

(Hint: if you fork to your own account, you can use
`http://[youTHESTARnamehere].github.com/agile2010/` to much the same result.

Testing
---------

    rake features

That runs Safari. And then does integration tests. What the customer will be
able see, you'll be able to test.

But you'll need:

  * [watir](http://watir.com/).

(Wow. A bullet-list. This is in preparation for you, the **star**, to make an even
more comple-- err, functional test infrastructure. You're gonna do that,
right?)

But you knew that. I can't believe I even implied you didn't. God. Right?
