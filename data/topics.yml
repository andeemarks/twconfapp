    title: "Rx: Curing Your Asynchronous Programming Blues"
    speakers: erik-meijer
    description: |
        <p>MS.Net</p>
        <p>Asynchronous, event-driven "reactive" programming is way too hard in today's world of development tools and frameworks. The huge amount of manual and error-prone plumbing leads to incomprehensible and hard to maintain code. As we reach out to services in the cloud, the desire for asynchronous computation is ever increasing, requiring a fresh look on the problems imposed by reactive programming. Centered around the concept of observable data sources, Rx provides a framework that takes care of the hard parts of reactive programming. Instead of focusing on the hard parts, you now can start dreaming about the endless possibilities of composing queries over asynchronous data sources, piggybacking on convenient LINQ syntax. In this session, we'll cover the design philosophy of Rx, rooted on the deep duality between the interactive IEnumerable interface and the new reactive IObservable interface in .NET 4. From this core understanding, we'll start looking at various combinators and operators defined over observable collections, as provided by Rx, driving concepts home by a bunch of samples. Finally, if time permits, we'll look at the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript which allows us to take the concepts we already know from Rx and apply them to JavaScript and have deep integration with libraries such as jQuery.  Democratizing asynchronous programming starts today. Don't miss out on it!</p>

    speakers: udi-dahan
    description: |
        <p>Enterprise</p>
        <p>Calling everything a service makes the term meaningless. Now, we've got 13 different kinds of services and no clue when to use which one. Is a single operation a service? Is a single endpoint a service? What about cross cutting functions like authorization and data access? If you've been wondering about these sorts of questions, then this talk is for you. If you've been looking for a top-down analysis and design process, then this talk is for you. If you've been looking for concrete guidance on how to choose technology for SOA, then this talk is for you. Join Udi as he describes the "missing links" in SOA: Business Components and Autonomous Components. It turns out that components are more important than ever in this new, service-oriented world.</p>

    title: "Fully Modular, Statically Typed, Symmetric Multimethod Dispatch"
    speakers: guy-steele
    description: |
        <p>Languages and Concurrency</p>
        <p>The Fortress programming language integrates traditional mathematical notation into an object-oriented framework based on traits with multiple inheritance, overloading (of both methods and functions) resolved by symmetric dynamic dispatch, static types, and separately compiled modules. A component/API system governs visibility of traits, objects, and functions, but it is desirable to regard overloadings that are visible to the callee as part of its implementation, even though they may not be visible to the caller. This complicates the rules for dispatch. Simply put, the same method name may refer to different methods in different compilation units, depending on the import and export declarations, and the implementation has to make it all work.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a longstanding problem with multiple inheritance is what to do when methods inherited from several parents conflict. Many approaches have been explored in the literature; some unfortunately violate the intuitively desirable requirement that the function or method invoked be the uniquely most specific one that is both accessible and applicable. Fortress detects potential overloading ambiguity at compile time and issues error messages explaining to the programmer what additional overloadings are needed to resolve the problem; therefore it is impossible for any function or method call to be ambiguous. This idea goes back nearly two decades, but Fortress appears to be the first programming language to adopt the idea and enforce it statically, even in the face of separate compilation. It enables a distributed implementation of dispatching that is easy to explain and allows selective export and selective optimization. In this way a single strategy meets the requirements of both the multimethod dispatch and the component visibility rules.</p>

    speakers: pamela-fox
    description: |
        <p>Cloud Computing</p>
        <p>Google App Engine is a framework that lets you build web apps on top of Google's scalable hosting and data storage infrastructure. When you start building an app on App Engine, you soon realize that you do things differently from the way you made apps for more "traditional" hosting setups, because of our scalability-oriented design. In this talk, we'll give an overview of App Engine, and then look at how you would handle things like offline processing, geographic queries, or storing files, and how you would design real world apps like a microblogging service or social network site.</p>
        <p>Keywords: AppEngine, Scalability, Architecture, Java, Python, CloudComputing, GoogleAPI , Experience, Web 2.0</p>
        <p>Target Audience:  Developers who are building App Engine apps or thinking of using App Engine for an upcoming project, and who want to learn how they might architect the backend for their application to work best on top of Google's hosting infrastructure.</p>

    title: Testing Your Javascript
    speakers: corey-haines
    description: |
        <p>Best Practices</p>
        <p>With the advent of new, fast virtual machines and frameworks for both in- and out-of-browser usage, Javascript has stepped into its rightful place as a productive, object-oriented language. More and more, we see full-featured applications being built entirely in this great language. Unfortunately, a lot of the coding habits remain from its humble origin as 'just an html scripting language.' Automated testing is accepted as standard in most other languages, why not in Javascript?</p>
        <p>In this talk, we'll look at techniques and tools for testing your Javascript effectively. Just getting the tools set up can be daunting, so we'll spend some time looking at setup. Testing interactions with your HTML can be tricky, so we'll cover tips for effectively interacting with your web pages in your tests.</p>
        <p>Keywords: Javascript, Testing, Craftsmanship, BestPractices, .NET, Design, TDD, XP</p>

        <p>Erlang is a programming language designed for the Internet Age, although it pre-dates the Web. It is a language designed for multi-core computers, although it pre-dates them too. It is a "beacon language", to quote Haskell guru Simon Peyton-Jones, in that it more clearly than any other language demonstrates the benefits of concurrency-oriented programming. In this talk, I will try to show how learning Erlang will make you a better programmer.</p>

        <p>Cloud Computing</p>
        <p>The misnamed "NoSQL" movement is less of a rejection of the relational technology that has served us well for 40 years, but rather an embrace of persistence technologies that help us solve problems not well addressed by the classic RDBMS. This talk will provide an overview of the "NoSQL" landscape and in addition, describe both the technology behind and a significant deployment example of Neo4J, a graph-oriented alternative data store.</p>

    date: Thu 3:20PM
    title: "Strategic Design: Avoiding Responsibility Traps"
    speakers: eric-evans
    description: |
        <p>Best Practices</p>
        <p>As software development leaders, we need to think more strategically. Some design decisions affect the trajectory of the whole project or even the organization. These decisions arise in early chartering and throughout development, and they are about much more than architecture. This talk will examine these issues through the lens of the Strategic Design principles of domain-driven design (DDD), which systematize a few critical practices some successful teams do intuitively.</p>
        <p>It is common for skilled teams to deliver software they are not proud of, due to compromises with legacy designs. Others toil for years, producing a platform that is never used to good advantage. These are strategic failures. On the other hand, there are projects with a direct explanation of how the software contributes to business goals. There are projects where designers work with a realistic view of the context of their development within the larger system, allowing them to maintain design clarity and integrity. These are strategic successes. Winning strategy starts with the domain.</p>
        <p>Two DDD principles, "Context Mapping" and "Distilling the Core Domain", help you see your strategic situation more clearly and approach strategic design decisions more systematically. These techniques require extensive interaction with domain experts as well as the leaders of the organization, in discussions broader than functional requirements. They sometimes lead to priorities quite different from our most comfortable notions.</p>

    description: |
        <p>Languages and Community</p>
        <p>People have been talking about "scaling" and "distributed systems" a great deal lately. We need to clarify the meaning of these terms in order to have a worthwhile conversation about them. We will do so by discussing the details of how to actually produce practical, scalable, distributed systems.</p>
        <p>That discussion will focus on methods for designing and building robust fundamentally-concurrent distributed systems. These approaches have been learned through building user-facing web applications, data storage and processing systems, and server management tools. We will look at practices that are "common knowledge" but too often forgotten, at lessons that the software industry at large has somehow missed, and at general "good practices" and rules that must be thrown away when moving into a distributed and concurrent world.</p>

    speakers: gregor-hohpe
    description: |
       <p>Cloud Computing</p>
       <p>Google is known to operate one of the largest civilian computing infrastructures. These hardware resources are managed by a vast collection of software frameworks and tools, which form the basis for highly parallelized, reliable, low-latency, high-throughput applications. They also provide useful programming abstractions that speed up development and debugging. Some parts of this infrastructure, such as MapReduce, GFS, Sawzall, Chubby, Protocol Buffers, are available as open source projects or published in academic papers, while others are proprietary. Rather than dive into the dark corners of each of these tools, this talk tries to distill key design themes and patterns, which enable these unique capabilities, and can be re-used in other contexts.</p>

        <p>Best Practices</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create applications that survive the rigors of life in production. Too often, project teams aim to pass QA instead of aiming for success in production. Testing is not enough to prove that your software is ready for continuous availability in the corrosive environment of the Internet.</p>
        <p>During this tutorial, you will receive an understanding of the architecture and design patterns that can produce high availability in distributed, multithreaded systems such as those based on Java EE, .Net, or Ruby on Rails. You will also learn about the antipatterns that can sabotage your systems availability and capacity.</p>

    title: Domain Modelling with Processes - Adventures of an 'object head' in Erlang Land
    speakers: kresten-thorup
    description: |
        <p>Languages and Community</p>
        <p>Erlang is a programming language which has been picking up steam the last few years, in particular in domains that require a lot of coordination in the application logic. The language supports a simple and consistent set of features for writing concurrent distributed systems.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, I have been meeting "Erlang people" more and more often, and I have been getting the impression that they have a magical ability to reason intuitively about concurrent systems in a way that I have not. It corresponds somewhat to the way we "object heads" think intuitively about classes and objects - just in terms of processes. That bothered me, so I wanted to learn Erlang.</p>
        <p>Being a language implementor, the most obvious way to do that is to just go ahead and implement an Erlang VM, right? The result of this "little exercise" is Erjang, an open-source JVM-based Erlang VM. It has turned into a non-trivial project, Erjang is now +50k lines of Java code, and it runs substantial erlang programs.</p>
        <p>This adventure to Erlang-land have taught me many things about how "Erlang people" think. I am beginning to understand how they think in processes/actors, how they model things and how they handle the complexity that arises in concurrent systems.</p>
        <p>In the first part of my talk, I'll go through some of these lessons, some of the aha!'s and the insights into Erlang's secret sauce, and present some of the patterns Erlang'ers use to describe and model systems.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I'll take you through some of the highlights of the Erjang VM; which is just another angle at describing how Erlang and Java differs.</p>

        <p>Languages - what's to learn from them? Relics of the past; we know how to design them / to use them. Types / messages / invocation / loops / numbers / methods / big ol' libraries / lots of = signs. Heh, but what is programming, and what role do programming languages play in that process? We have learned a lot over the last five decades: organizing principles, established conventions, theory, fashions, and fads. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." In this talk we survey what we think are the most important lessons of the past that future programmers, and future programming language designers, ought not forget. We illustrate each lesson by discussing specific programming languages of the past, and endeavor to shine what light we can on the future.</p>

    speakers: ian-robinson
    description: |
        <p>Web 2.0 Architecture</p>
        <p>REST is ready for the enterprise. Imagine an information platform that is open and available to systems throughout the enterprise estate. A platform that eschews integration in favour of composition, connected data over siloed databases. A networked data structure with the power to implement valuable business behaviours: a distributed, hypermedia-driven application platform. Using techniques drawn from the forthcoming O'Reilly book 'REST in Practice', in this session I show how to model business processes as domain application protocols, implement them in terms of resource lifecycles, and execute them using HTTP idioms, media types and link relation values.</p>
