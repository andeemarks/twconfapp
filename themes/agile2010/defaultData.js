A component/API system governs visibility of traits, objects, and functions, but it is desirable to regard overloadings that are visible to the callee as part of its implementation, even though they may not be visible to the caller. This complicates the rules for dispatch. Simply put, the same method name may refer to different methods in different compilation units, depending on the import and export declarations, and the implementation has to make it all work.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a longstanding problem with multiple inheritance is what to do when methods inherited from several parents conflict. Many approaches have been explored in the literature; some unfortunately violate the intuitively desirable requirement that the function or method invoked be the uniquely most specific one that is both accessible and applicable. Fortress detects potential overloading ambiguity at compile time and issues error messages explaining to the programmer what additional overloadings are needed to resolve the problem; therefore it is impossible for any function or method call to be ambiguous. This idea goes back nearly two decades, but Fortress appears to be the first programming language to adopt the idea and enforce it statically, even in the face of separate compilation. It enables a distributed implementation of dispatching that is easy to explain and allows selective export and selective optimization. In this way a single strategy meets the requirements of both the multimethod dispatch and the component visibility rules.</p>\n<p>Keywords: Languages, Java, Fortress, ScientificComputing</p>\n<p>Target Audience:  Developers with an interest in next-generation object-oriented languages</p>","speakers":"guy-steele"},"morning-tea":{"title":"Morning Tea","date":"Thu 10:00AM"},"rx-curing":{"title":"Rx: Curing Your Asynchronous Programming Blues","date":"Thu 11:20AM","description":"<p>MS.Net</p>\n<p>Asynchronous, event-driven \"reactive\" programming is way too hard in today's world of development tools and frameworks. The huge amount of manual and error-prone plumbing leads to incomprehensible and hard to maintain code. As we reach out to services in the cloud, the desire for asynchronous computation is ever increasing, requiring a fresh look on the problems imposed by reactive programming. Centered around the concept of observable data sources, Rx provides a framework that takes care of the hard parts of reactive programming. Instead of focusing on the hard parts, you now can start dreaming about the endless possibilities of composing queries over asynchronous data sources, piggybacking on convenient LINQ syntax. In this session, we'll cover the design philosophy of Rx, rooted on the deep duality between the interactive IEnumerable interface and the new reactive IObservable interface in .NET 4. From this core understanding, we'll start looking at various combinators and operators defined over observable collections, as provided by Rx, driving concepts home by a bunch of samples. Finally, if time permits, we'll look at the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript which allows us to take the concepts we already know from Rx and apply them to JavaScript and have deep integration with libraries such as jQuery.
