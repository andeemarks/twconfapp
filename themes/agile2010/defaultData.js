In major product companies significant revenue comes from customers of existing legacy products and their support revenues. Hence it isn't surprising that 70-85% of the software development budget is allocated to the operation and enhancement Legacy Code. For many companies their most successful product/application has become their worst enemy. Painfully we have learned that languages, tools, methods and practices we have often been unable to replace or even substantially reduce the entropy of our legacy code. Indeed it is generally accepted today that a major rewrite of any large legacy application has way too much risk and way too little business value to be given serious consideration. We have no choice but to live with and improve our Legacy!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately major Legacy Systems is an area where most in Agile community fear to tread. This is due in part to their lack of experience in these environments. It is also due to their expectations for tool chains and deployment models which are matched to the Agile expectations of incremental OO development and associated tool chains.</p>\n<p>In this talk we discuss how Lean thinking and Agile have been applied to real legacy systems spanning mainframe, military, embedded and multi-vendor integration of legacy and EAP applications.
