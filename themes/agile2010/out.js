In the throws of such pervasive change the traditional emphasis on "following the plan with minimal changes," needs to be supplanted by an agile stress on "adapting successfully to inevitable changes." Furthermore, if agility is about delivering customer value by being flexible, then how can adherence to a traditional scope, schedule, and cost plan be the best way to measure performance? It can\'t. We need to move beyond the classic Iron Triangle measures to an Agile Triangle that focuses on Value, Quality, and Constraints.</p>\n<p>Agile teams are asked to be agile, flexible, and adaptive, but then are told to conform to planned scope, schedule, and cost goals. They are asked to adapt, but inside a very small box. If we are to scale agility to large projects and bring agile values to organizations, then we must change performance measures. To mirror the Agile Manifesto, it\'s not that scope, schedule, and cost are unimportant, but that value and quality are more important. This keynote explores the necessity for and the rationale behind moving to this new set of agile performance measures.</p>\n',

In major product companies significant revenue comes from customers of existing legacy products and their support revenues. Hence it isn't surprising that 70-85% of the software development budget is allocated to the operation and enhancement Legacy Code. For many companies their most successful product/application has become their worst enemy. Painfully we have learned that languages, tools, methods and practices we have often been unable to replace or even substantially reduce the entropy of our legacy code. Indeed it is generally accepted today that a major rewrite of any large legacy application has way too much risk and way too little business value to be given serious consideration. We have no choice but to live with and improve our Legacy!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately major Legacy Systems is an area where most in Agile community fear to tread. This is due in part to their lack of experience in these environments. It is also due to their expectations for tool chains and deployment models which are matched to the Agile expectations of incremental OO development and associated tool chains.</p>\n<p>In this talk we discuss how Lean thinking and Agile have been applied to real legacy systems spanning mainframe, military, embedded and multi-vendor integration of legacy and EAP applications. We illustrate by example how organisations can benefit by using Lean and Agile to reduce the entropy (improve Agility) of their legacy systems and hence maximize the value they can get from them.

This presentation will discuss how to do this in a way that stays focused on our goals and not on our Agile score.</p>\n",
speakers:"jason-yip, marina-chiovetti"},"government-case-studies":{title:"Government Case Studies - CCH2",date:"Wed 04:45PM",description:"<p>The story of information management at NOPSA begins in the distant past, at a time when the most advanced form of information is a spreadsheet, and most business activities are completely dependent on the movement of pieces of paper. The inhabitants of this primeval world resolve to create an application that assists their core business processes, reduces their compliance burden and prevents data rot.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the project faces some challenges.</p>\n<li>The defining legislation is being added to and amended at unpredictable intervals - by three or four governments.</li>\n<li>Some of the business processes have never been agreed on.</li>\n<li>Senior management believe that 80% of software development projects end in catastrophic failure and financial waste.</li>\n<li>\u2026 and a minor cargo cult has developed around the project, with each stakeholder believing that their specialised requirements will be delivered.</li>\n<br/>\n<p>Recognising that a classic sequential project would waste resources from day one, NOPSA began a search for a development capability that would be flexible, achieve results quickly and focus relentlessly on user needs.</p>\n<p>This is the story of how we delivered less software, but more business value than we expected. It is also a story of how management skepticism evolved into commitment, and how our inspectors' anxiety gave way to ownership.</p>\n<p>There is a brief discussion of what worked well, particularly those characteristics of NOPSA that were useful to the process (yes, they can exist in a government agency !).</p>\n<p>This session finishes with a summary of the factors that have made Agile 'the way we do things' at NOPSA.</p>\n",
